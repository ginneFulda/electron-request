Crome: Before Purgatory is a game that pays homage to the classic arcade shooters of the 80s and 90s. The game has a pixel art style that mimics the Game Boy aesthetic, with green and black colors and simple graphics. The game also has a catchy chiptune soundtrack that matches the retro vibe.
 
The game is easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. You control Crome's ship with the arrow keys and shoot with the Z key. You can also use the X key to activate a special attack that clears the screen of enemies and bullets, but it has a cooldown time. You have to dodge the enemy fire and collect power-ups that increase your firepower, speed, and health. The game gets harder as you progress, with more enemies and faster bullets. The game also has a scoring system that rewards you for destroying enemies and staying alive.
 
The game's main attraction is the boss fight against the Death Comet, a giant asteroid that has different forms and attacks. The Death Comet changes every time you encounter it, so you have to adapt your strategy and learn its patterns. The Death Comet can shoot lasers, missiles, mines, and more. It can also summon smaller asteroids and enemies to aid it. The Death Comet is a formidable foe that will test your skills and reflexes.

Crome: Before Purgatory is a short but sweet game that can be completed in less than an hour. However, the game has a lot of replay value, as you can try to beat your own score and compete with other players on the online leaderboard. The game also has 10 achievements that challenge you to complete various tasks, such as defeating the Death Comet without using the special attack, or destroying 1000 enemies in one run.
 
The game can be played with a keyboard or a controller. The game supports Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, as well as other compatible controllers. You can also customize the controls to your liking in the options menu. The game also has a fullscreen mode and a windowed mode that you can switch between with the F4 key.
 
Crome: Before Purgatory is a game that will appeal to fans of retro shoot 'em up games, as well as anyone who enjoys a fast-paced and challenging action game. The game is a prequel to Super Crome, which is still in development and promises to be an even bigger and better game. If you want to support the developer and get a taste of what Super Crome will be like, you should check out Crome: Before Purgatory today!
