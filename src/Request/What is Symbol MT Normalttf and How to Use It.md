    However, Symbol MT Normal.ttf is not a standard font that is supported by all browsers and devices. Therefore, if you want to use it in HTML, you need to embed the font file in your web page using the @font-face rule. This way, the font will be downloaded and displayed by the browser even if the user does not have it installed on their computer. You can learn more about how to use @font-face [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp).

    Another option is to use Unicode characters instead of Symbol MT Normal.ttf. Unicode is a universal standard that assigns a unique code to every symbol and character in the world. Most browsers and devices can display Unicode characters without any problem. You can find a list of Unicode symbols and characters [here](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_symbols.asp). To use Unicode characters in HTML, you need to type the code preceded by an ampersand (&) and followed by a semicolon (;). For example, to type the black spade suit symbol (â ), you need to type &#x2660;.
